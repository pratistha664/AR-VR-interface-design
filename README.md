AR/VR Interface Design – Vision Profile Interface in Figma

For Task 4 of my internship project, I designed an AR/VR interface concept using Figma, taking inspiration from modern e-commerce-style app UI, specifically tailored for a “Vision Board” themed personal profile experience. My goal was to create an engaging and immersive user interface that would feel intuitive and futuristic, while still grounded in familiar mobile app patterns.

The interface begins with a clean status bar resembling that of an Android device, anchoring the user’s view with essential indicators such as time, signal, and battery—providing a real-world touchpoint that helps bridge the gap between the virtual and physical user experience. This choice ensures users feel oriented even in immersive environments.

Central to my design is a profile interface that represents the user’s "vision board" journey. I used a bold hero image of a girl wearing a VR headset, much like the example image, to symbolize immersion and self-exploration in virtual reality. The image serves as both a thematic statement and a visual anchor, immediately drawing attention and setting the tone for the interface.

Below the hero section, I created a clean layout for personal profile details: name, short bio, and interactive metrics like the number of vision boards created, personal achievements, and current aspirations. These elements are styled using modern design principles—white backgrounds, card components with soft shadows, and icons with high recognizability. The arrangement is both minimal and visually engaging, maintaining clarity and ease of navigation.

I also incorporated interactive components that could later be extended into AR/VR formats. These include swipeable cards (like the headset product lists in the reference image), floating action buttons for creating new vision boards, and a menu bar for quick navigation between sections such as Home, Explore, Wishlist, and Profile. The icons and layout mimic familiar e-commerce UI design, making the experience intuitive for users transitioning from 2D apps to immersive 3D spaces.

The design’s aesthetic is clean and professional, with a monochromatic base and subtle gradients to maintain visual interest without overwhelming the user. Font choices are bold yet legible, and button styles follow a soft, rounded aesthetic, which adds friendliness and modernity.

While this prototype is shown in Figma as a 2D mobile interface, it has been conceptualized with AR/VR usability in mind. Users in a VR space could interact with profile elements using gestures or voice, while AR users could see vision board components overlaid in their real environment, creating a deeply personalized and engaging digital experience.

In conclusion, this task allowed me to blend practical UI/UX principles with imaginative, immersive design thinking. The interface stands as a concept for a potential AR/VR vision board app where users can track, visualize, and share their aspirations in a way that’s both personal and futuristic.
